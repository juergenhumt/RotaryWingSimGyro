Finally I have managed to calculate the tests given in naca-475. My program seems to consistenly underestimate the lateral disk tilt b1, which were calculated using naca-716. A look at the result listings shows that Bramwells formula for b1 gives better results, I can currently not explain why. Regarding the higher value of rotor rpm for test case 10 my impression is that this is one  of the rare cases where there is an error in a naca report. The aircraft gross weight is given as 2930 lb while rotor lift is 2610 lb. This is not possible since the aircraft is in level flight (2.1 deg nose down). I have recalculated case 10 using 2610 lb and here the rotor speed is in much better agreement. The values of lift force distribution between wings and rotor are in good agreement over the whole flight range. The stability calculation in the listing file shows that the aircraft is stable over the whole flight range. These values should be used with caution since they were calculated without changes in rotor speed.
